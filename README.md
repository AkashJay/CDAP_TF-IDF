<h2> Machine Learning Preprocessing Analyzer for sinhala language </h2>


<p>Apache Lucene is a free open-source information software library which is originally completely written
in Java. This library includes many analyzers to index different contents in different languages and
domains.
<br>
(List of Analyzers which are currently available -&gt;
https://lucene.apache.org/core/7_5_0/analyzerscommon/index.html).
<br>
Most frequently used analyzer is English Analyzer. Some languages like Sinhala still don&#39;t have their own
analyzers, so they use English analyzer to analyze the document contents. Since these are two different
languages it is not much accurately analyzed. Sinhala language which is our mother tongue is also facing
the same issues. Most of available analyzing techniques are language dependent<br>
<p>As a Sri lankan research team our main goal is to build a analyzer for Sinhala language.</b> <br>
Tokenization, Stopword Removing, Stemming Algorithms, Lemmatization Algorithms are four main
techniques in every analyzer which are currently available.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Tokenization Algorithm:<br>
We are going to implement a proper algorithm which will accurately tokenize the Sinhala language Documents.</li>
  <li>Stopword Removal Algorithm:<br>
In our solution we are going to implement a algorithm to remove common stopword as well as a algorithm to remove domain specific stopwords.</li>
  <li>Stemming Algorithm:<br>
For Sinhala we are going to build language dependent stemming algorithm to Â perform the process of reducing inflected or sometimes derived words to their word stem, root form.</li>
  <li>Lemmatization Algorithm:<br>
In Lemmatization we are going to implement an algorithm for the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed as a single item.</li>

</ul>
